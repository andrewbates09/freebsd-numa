/*
 * FreeBSD NUMA project - userspace
 * 
 * The numanor.h userspace library takes advantage of NUMA functionality exposed
 * by the freebsdnuma.h syscalls.  In short, this abstracts the syscalls
 * included in freebsdnuma.h and makes them more user friendly.  Users should be
 * able to make their application NUMA-aware by using these functions.  Also
 * included are basic functions to test NUMA.

 * Summary: If this function evaluates as true (1-n nodes), the current machine
 *      is found to have NUMA architecture, and the functions included below
 *      should be available.  If this evaluates to false (0), the current 
 *      machine does not have NUMA architecture, and should not be allowed to
 *      use the following functions. The integer returned is the number of NUMA
 *      nodes available.
