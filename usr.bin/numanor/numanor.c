 * FreeBSD NUMA project - userspace

 * The numanor.h userspace library takes advantage of NUMA functionality exposed
 * by the freebsdnuma.h syscalls.  In short, this abstracts the syscalls
 * included in freebsdnuma.h and makes them more user friendly.  Users should be
 * able to make their application NUMA-aware by using these functions.  Also
 * included are basic functions to test NUMA.
